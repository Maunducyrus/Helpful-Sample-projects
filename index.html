        <p>
            An <b>interpreter</b> translates a source program word by word or line by
            line.<br>This allows the CPU to execute one line at a time.<br>
            • The <b>Interpreter</b> takes one line of the source program, <br>translates it into
            a machine instruction,<br> and then it is immediately executed by the
            CPU.
        </p>
        <p>
            • A <b>compiler</b> translates the entire/whole source program into object
            code at once, <br>and then executes it in machine language code.<br> These
            machine code instructions can then be run on the computer to<br>
            perform the particular task as specified in the high-level program.<br>
        </p>
            • An <b>assembler</b> translates programs written in Assembly language into<br>
            machine language that the computer can understand and execute.
              
            <p>
            •<b>Linking</b>-C-programs typically contain differences to functions defined<br>
            elsewhere such as in the standard library or in private libraries groups<br>
            of programmers working on a particular project.<br>
            •<b>Linker</b>-Links the object code with the source code to ensure no<br>
            missing functions to produce an executable program(no missing
            pieces)<br>
            • <b>Loading phase</b>-Before the program can be executed the program<br>
            must first be placed in the memory, this is done by the loader.<br>

        <h2><u>COMPUTER REPAIRS</u></h2>
        <h3>GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR REPAIRING COMPUTERS</h3>
<b>For repairing or trouble-shooting acomputer use the following guidelines:</b>
<p style="color:red"><b>Gather together your toolkit:</b></p> e.g. air blowing machine, screw drivers,<br>
parts organizer, back up disk etc.
<p style="color:red"><b>Check for power FIRST, before doing anything else.</b></p><br>
-10 - 15 percent of all computer Issues/Problems emanate from power
surge. <br>Check this BEFORE doing anything else. <br>Check to be sure if the
computer is plugged in to an AC outlet properly.<br>
<p style="color:red"><b>Check your external connections to the computer</b></p>.<br>
-Speciﬁcally, check the mouse, keyboard, monitor, modem and/or printer
cables,<br> making sure that all are secure and in the right sockets.
<p style="color:red"><b>Perform the Power On Self Test (POST)</b></p>
POST is a set of procedures that a computer runs through when<br> it is
turned on. <br>It ensures that all of the system's hardware is working properly
before trying to load the operating system.<br> If the computer does not pass
POST, it will not boot.<br>
<b>NOTE</b><br> Make sure the computer turns on. <br>If nothing happens (no lights, no
sound, no fans, etc the computer has a power related issue.<br>

<section id="MAINTENANCE">
<h2><u>COMPUTER HARDWRARE REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE</u></h2>
<h3>GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR REPAIRING COMPUTERS</h3>
<em>If the computer is all malfunctioning, go ahead then and
open the case.</em>
<p>Check to see that all of the cards are fully pressed down
into the bus connection,<br> That any socketed chips are fully
pressed into their sockets, <br>and that all cable connections
are fully attached.<br> Make sure that the drive cables are
attached correctly.</p>
<p>Clean any dust or foreign material out of the case while it
is open.<br>
Dust can cause overheating problems and electrical shorts.<br>
Sometimes insects will nest inside the case as well. <br>All of
this needs to be cleaned out before you close up the case.<br>
Take precautions to avoid inhaling excess dust, <br>and
consider using protective eyeware if necessary.</p><br>
